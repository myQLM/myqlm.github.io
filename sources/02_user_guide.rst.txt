User guide
==========

.. parseonly:: qlm

    These part of the document clarifies main concepts, and the design of Qaptiva 800s. This **user guide** is divided in 3 main sections:

     - **writing quantum programs** provides the keys to creating quantum algorithms, using different quantum paradigm (gate-based, analog, quantum annealing)
     - **executing quantum programs** describe the design of this framework. It explains the procedure to execute quantum algorithms on a QPU, and describes how
       a QPU can be extended to support advanced computation (e.g. variational)
     - **compiling and rewriting quantum circuits** describes all the tool available to rewrite, reduce the gate count, and transpile a quantum circuit, to
       make it runnable on any quantum hardware


.. parseonly:: distributed

    These part of the document clarifies main concepts, and the design of Distributed Qaptiva. This **user guide** is divided in 3 main sections:

     - **writing quantum programs** provides the keys to creating quantum algorithms, using different quantum paradigm (gate-based, analog, quantum annealing)
     - **executing quantum programs** describe the design of this framework. It explains the procedure to execute quantum algorithms on a QPU, and describes how
       a QPU can be extended to support advanced computation (e.g. variational)

.. parseonly:: myqlm

    These part of the document clarifies main concepts, and the design of myQLM. This **user guide** is divided in 3 main sections:
