Noisy simulations
=================

Noise models for analog quantum computers differ from those of digital quantum computers in that they describe the action of the environment in a *continuous time* fashion.

Generically, noise can be described as the coupling of the environment to the quantum system of interest via the general Hamiltonian

.. math::

    H_\mathrm{tot} = H + H_\mathrm{env} + H_\mathrm{coupling}

with :math:`H`, :math:`H_\mathrm{env}` and :math:`H_\mathrm{coupling}` as the Hamiltonians of the system, the environment and the coupling, respectively. On |product| we can take two distinct paths to specify this joint Hamiltonian - either with the :code:`jump_operators`, or the stochastic :code:`params_specification` field of the analog QPU:
