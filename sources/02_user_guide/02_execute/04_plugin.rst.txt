Extending a QPU (by using Plugins)
==================================
The QAT (for *Qaptiva Application Toolset*) library defines a concept, named **Plugin**, designed to extend the capabilities of a
:ref:`QPU <qpu>`. In this framework, QPUs can execute jobs to return a result. This simple behavior reaches its limits when manipulating
advanced jobs, using a QPU not capable of executing the job (e.g. limited qubits connectivity, limited gate set, etc.)

.. card:: Use case
   :class-card: qaptiva-use-case

    I want to execute a variational job (e.g. a VQE algorithm) on a QPU which does not support observable measurement. Moreover, my job
    needs to be transpiled to be executed on my QPU.

    **How to execute a such job?**

    I can use plugins to extend my QPU. My improved QPU will:

     - compile any incomming job
     - execute variational jobs (e.g. my QPU will use scipy to find the optimal value for any abstract variable)
     - support observable measurement (e.g. incomming jobs will be decomposed into a list of sample jobs, and by post-processing
       their result, my QPu will return an averable value)

**Plugins** are objects that can process a flow of quantum jobs on their way to a **QPU**, and/or process a flow of information (samples or values) on their way back from a **QPU**.

Their API is composed of two methods:

    * **compile** for the way in (i.e from the user to the **QPU**).
      This method will take a :class:`~qat.core.Batch` together with some
      :class:`~qat.core.HardwareSpecs` and return a new
      :class:`~qat.core.Batch`.
    * **post_process** for the way out (i.e from the **QPU** to the user).
      This method will process a :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult` and return
      either a :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult` or a new
      :class:`~qat.core.Batch` that should go back to the **QPU**.

This simple semantics allow to compose **Plugin** to form expressive compilation stacks and extend the features provided by a **QPU**.
Creating a stack using plugins is quite straightforward:

.. code-block:: python

    my_stack = plugin1 | plugin2 | .. | my_qpu

In this code, when a fresh batch or job is submitted, the batch will run through the *compile* of `plugin1`, the resulting batch will run through the *compile* of `plugin2`, etc. 
When reaching `my_qpu` the execution will start, and the results will be processed in reversed order on their way back.

Overall the information flow can be summed up as follows:

**Plugins** can be used to perform a wide range of transformation, our library provides a set of plugins defined in :mod:`qat.plugins`
module but one can define its own plugin 

.. _remote_plugin:

.. dropdown:: Creating a remote Plugin and accessing it

    Any Plugin defined in our framework can be started in server mode, and can be accessed using myQLM or from any other Qaptiva Appliance, using a synchronous connection.
    This section explains the creation of a server and also how to connect to a remote Plugin

    .. note::

        :ref:`Qaptiva Access <qaptiva_access>` provides advanced tools to create dynamically remote Plugins (and even more) and access it remotely, using an asynchronous connection

    .. tab-set::

        .. tab-item:: Server side

            Any plugin has a method :meth:`~qat.plugins.AbstractPlugin.serve` to start this plugin in server mode. 
            This method takes the PORT and the IP as arguments. For instance:

            .. code-block:: python

                from qat.plugins import Remap

                # Define a PORT and a IP
                PORT = 1234
                IP = "*"

                # Define a plugin
                plugin = Remap()
                plugin.serve(PORT, IP)

        .. tab-item:: Client side

            If a distant plugin is started in server mode, our framework can be used as client of a connection. Assuming the server is listening to
            the port :code:`1234` and the ip of the server is :code:`127.0.0.1`, :class:`~qat.plugins.RemotePlugin` can be used to connect to this server:

            .. code-block:: python

                from qat.plugins import RemotePlugin

                # Define PORT and IP
                PORT = 1234
                IP = "127.0.0.1"

                # Define a client
                plugin = RemotePlugin(PORT, IP)

            .. warning::

                The connection is synchronous, therefore, if the client is disconnected during the pre-processing or the post-processing, result of the execution is lost

A **Plugin** can re-submit batches to the QPU, nevertheless, the *QAT* library provides a subtype of plugin, called **Junction**, providing a more convenient API to design plugins
resubmitting jobs sequentially (e.g. a plugin optimizing angles of a variational job)

.. warning::

    A plugin can post-process a result. Then, the batch returned by the compilation step may not be equal to the initial batch (the post-process method
    can be used to repair a result, to return the expected result to the user)
