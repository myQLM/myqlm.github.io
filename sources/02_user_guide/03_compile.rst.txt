Compiling and rewriting quantum circuits
========================================

|product| provides a set of tools to compile, or to rewrite quantum circuits. These tools can be used to adapt an existing circuit to make it run on a specific hardware
(by changing the gate set or by considering the topology), or to optimize an existing circuit (e.g. merge consecutive one qubit gates, removing consecutive Hadamard gates)

These tools are grouped in 2 categories:

 - **Compiler plugins**: These automated tools are designed to update any quantum jobs before submitting it to the QPU. These tools relies on the function grouped
   in the two categories below
 - **Circuit rewriting**: These tools are designed to edit a quantum circuit, based on rewriting rules. These rules include KAK compression, pattern matching,
   etc.

Please note that |product| provides tools to :ref:`synthesize quantum circuits <circuit_synthesis>`, this feature is discussed in another section
