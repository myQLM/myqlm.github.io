    Qaptiva 800s documentation
    ==========================

    **Qaptiva 800 series** is the Quantum Appliance developed by Eviden. This appliance replaces the *Quantum Learning Machine (QLM)*, any code written on a Quantum Learning Machine
    remains executable on Qaptiva 800s. Qaptiva 800s provides the :mod:`qat` library (for **Qaptiva Application Toolset**), which includes:

     - a **powerful semantic** for :ref:`writing quantum algorithms <writing>` (i.e. gate-based programming, analog programming, or quantum annealing programming)
     - a **versatile execution stack** for :ref:`running quantum jobs <executing>`, including an easy handling of :ref:`observables <observable>`, special tools for carrying NISQ-oriented
       :ref:`variational methods <running_variational>` (such as VQE, QAOA), an easy API for :ref:`designing custom plugins <plugin>` (e.g. transpilers), as well as for connecting to any Quantum Processing
       Unit (QPU)
     - **advanced compilers** to :ref:`transpile a quantum circuit <transpilation>`, to make it run on any QPU Hardware

    myQLM – QC Python Package
    =========================

    **myQLM** is the quantum software stack developed by `Eviden <https://eviden.com/solutions/advanced-computing/quantum-computing/>`_, for writing, simulating, optimizing, and executing quantum programs. Through a Python interface, it provides:

     - a **powerful semantic** for :ref:`writing quantum algorithms <writing>` (gate-based programing, analog programing, or quantum annealing programing)
     - a **versatile execution stack** for :ref:`running quantum jobs <executing>`, including an easy handling of :ref:`observables <observable>`, special tools for carrying NISQ-oriented
       :ref:`variational methods <running_variational>` (such as VQE, QAOA), an easy API for :ref:`designing custom plugins <plugin>` (e.g. compilation), as well as for connecting to any Quantum Processing
       Unit (QPU)
     - a **seamless interface** to :ref:`available quantum processors and major quantum programming frameworks <interop>`
