Most useful Circuit methods
---------------------------

One can easily concatenate two :class:`~qat.core.Circuit` objects with the overloaded
:code:`__add__` operator (as long as they have the same number of qubits):

.. code-block:: python

    cat_circuit = circuit1 + circuit2

Tensorial composition is implemented via an overloading of the :code:`__mult__` operator:

.. code-block:: python

    kron_circuit = circuit1 * circuit2

Among the other useful methods, we can find:

* The direct generation of a :class:`~qat.core.Job` object from a circuit using various parameters,
  with the :meth:`~qat.core.Circuit.to_job` method:

    .. code-block:: python

        job = circuit.to_job(job_type="SAMPLE", nbshots=1024, qubits=[0, 3, 7])

* Serialization/deserialization of a circuit can be done using the :meth:`~qat.core.Circuit.dump`
  and :meth:`~qat.core.Circuit.load` methods:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit.dump("my_circuit.circ")
        circuit = Circuit.load("my_circuit.circ")

* Binding of abstract variables using the :meth:`~qat.core.Circuit.bind_variables` method:

    .. code-block:: python

        new_circuit = circuit(theta=0.34)
        # or, equivalently
        new_circuit = circuit.bind_variables({theta: 0.34})


Iterating of a Circuit
______________________

* Iterating over the instructions using the :meth:`~qat.core.Circuit.iterate_simple` method

.. run-block::  python

    from qat.lang.AQASM import Program
    from qat.lang.AQASM.qftarith import QFT

    prog = Program()
    qbits = prog.qalloc(4)
    QFT(4)(qbits)
    prog.measure([qbits[0], qbits[3]])
    prog.reset(qbits[2])
    circuit = prog.to_circ()

    for instruction in circuit.iterate_simple():
        print(instruction)

* Iterating over raw instructions (for advanced usage):

.. run-block:: python

    from qat.lang.AQASM import Program
    from qat.lang.AQASM.qftarith import QFT

    prog = Program()
    qbits = prog.qalloc(4)
    QFT(4)(qbits)
    prog.measure([qbits[0], qbits[3]])
    prog.reset(qbits[2])
    circuit = prog.to_circ()

    for instruction in circuit:
        print(instruction)


Qubits and cbits
________________

The number of qubits and classical bits declared in the circuit can be accessed like so:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit.nbqbits
    circuit.nbcbits

At circuit generation, the convention is to extend the number of classical bits to match the number
of declared qubits. So it might be that your didn't declare any cbits in pyAQASM, and still end up
with a non-zero number of classical bits.

The field `nbqbits` might also be extended to match the total number of qbits used by the circuit
(for instance if a sub-routine is using some ancillae that are dynamically allocated at
inlining/emulation/execution).

This extension requires to emulate the flow of the circuit.

All quantum registers declared in pyAQASM can be found in the `.qregs` field.
The type of these registers is also stored in the QReg structure:

.. code-block:: python

    for qreg in circuit.qregs:
        print("Register of length {} starting at {}".format(qreg.length, qreg.start))


Please refer :ref:`this section of the user guide regarding quantum types <oracles>` for more
information on registers.
