myQLM Installation on MacOS
---------------------------
MyQLM on MacOS supports three environments: Homebrew, Python.org and Conda.
Attention, mismatching those environments will likely cause a Segmentation fault.

Installing myQLM on MacOS will require two packages to be installed first. The recommended way to install them is to use brew.

 - myQLM depends on *qdldl*. Conda provides *qdldl*. However, for CPython, this package may not be available as a wheel file in pypi.org and therefore needs to be compiled on your system. Compiling *qdldl* requires CMake to be installed:

   .. code-block:: bash

        brew install cmake
