GENERIC SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MYQLM (hereinafter referred to as “Generic Software EULA”).

RECITALS

IMPORTANT: This BULL End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal document that binds any company or physical person (“You”)with all obligations contained in the present document provided by Bull SAS (as identified in the footnote) for the software product identified below, which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation (collectively, the "SOFTWARE").

The SOFTWARE's primary function is to allow Users (e.g. students, researchers, developers) to develop their own quantum algorithms and test them on their infrastructure before running them on an Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM) to benefit from additional functionalities such as optimizers and noisy simulation.

The SOFTWARE is a combination of several modules, licensed accordingly:
•   under a user license agreement for the BULL proprietary part (runtime),
•   and under the Apache V2.0 user license agreement for the open source part.

The files for each of these two categories of software are available at the root of the SOFTWARE packages in a dedicated EULA folder. You must read these licenses and comply with the terms thereof. All terms set out in this Generic EULA shall apply to the EULA for the Proprietary part and the open source Part.

PLEASE READ THIS EULA CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND USING THE SOFTWARE. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, then do not install or use the SOFTWARE.

SOFTWARE LICENSE
1.  DEFINITIONS
(a) "BULL" equals Bull SAS.
(b) “User” means any person using the Software in accordance with the EULA.
(c) “User of the SOFTWARE” means any natural person or legal entity wishing to use the SOFTWARE various features.
(d) “Software” means Bull’s product including a proprietary part as well as an open source part, each having its own terms of use as provided with this Generic Software EULA.

2.  TERMS OF USE
The License is granted to the User of the SOFTWARE following the acceptation of the End-User License Agreement (“EULA”). Two specific EULA are provided for both the proprietary part and the open source. You must refer to each of them for using the Software. As User of the SOFTWARE, "You" or the authorized representative of the legal entity, acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the terms of use for each category of software and shall refrain from violating them in any way. By downloading, installing, or using the SOFTWARE in any way whatsoever You acknowledge that You have read the license terms and conditions of use of each category of software and that you agree to be bound thereunder.

3.  CONFIDENTIALITY
Both EULAs for each category shall be subject to the following confidentiality provisions: Nondisclosure. Each Party (each a "Receiving Party") agrees that it shall use and reproduce the Confidential Information of the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") only for purposes of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement and only to the extent necessary for such purposes; shall restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's employees, consultants, or advisors who have a need to know; and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The foregoing obligations shall be satisfied by the Receiving Party through the exercise of at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own information of like importance, but not less than reasonable care. All third parties to whom the Receiving Party discloses Confidential Information must be bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or proceeding, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior notice and reasonable assistance to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to and/or limit the judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure. Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be liable for using or disclosing information that such Party can prove:
 (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party;
 (ii) was known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure;
 (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party;
 (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the time of such independent development;
 (v) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and otherwise not in violation of the Disclosing Party's rights; or
 (vi) is disclosed generally to third parties by the Disclosing Party without restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement. Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Section 11 may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party that money damages alone may be inadequate to compensate. Therefore, in the event of such a breach, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction without the posting of a bond or other security.

4.  MISCELLANEOUS
4.1 Assignment. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Bull. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Trigger may, without the consent of Users, assign this Agreement to an entity merging with, consolidating with, or purchasing substantially all its assets or stock, provided that the assignee shall assume all rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any permitted assignment of this Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable by and against the Parties' successors and assigns, provided that any unauthorized assignment shall be null and void and constitute a breach of this Agreement.
4.2 Export control requirements. Users acknowledges and agrees that the Software may be subject to export control laws and regulations. Users may not download or otherwise export or re-export the Software or any underlying information or technology except in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
4.3 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be responsible for delays or failure to perform any of its obligations herein (other than payment obligations) resulting from or in connection with acts, events, or circumstances beyond the reasonable or foreseeable control of such Party. Such acts shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God (including earthquakes, hurricanes and volcanic eruptions), strikes, lockouts, riots, civil unrest, civil protests, acts of war, epidemics (including communicable disease outbreaks and public health emergencies), governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, power failure, or other disasters, whether such acts have been identified, declared or accepted as such under the relevant law or not. In such circumstances as listed above, the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or failed to be perform, provided that if in the reasonable opinion of the Affected Party performance of the Agreement is substantially prevented for a continuous period of six (6) months from the date on which such performance was initially due by virtue of any of the aforesaid events, then either Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other. Both Parties will use all reasonable endeavors to mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations. In particular, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to adopt together some mitigation measures in order to decrease the impact of the Force Majeure Event, such as remote working, off or nearshoring, etc., as far as they are proportionate, adequate and in compliance with the law.
4.4 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of France without giving effect to its conflicts of law rules. Each of the Parties to this Agreement consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the competent courts of Paris if the Parties fail to settle their dispute in a friendly manner within sixty (60) days.
